# Announcing the food button project! #
The food button is a method to alert fellow ACM members that there is food present in the office (we may need some legislation passed about usage). When the button is pressed:
1. Controller (beaglebone) recognizes the event and snaps a photo of the food station
2. The photo is emailed to everybody on the acm food (idk if this actually exists) list serv...and maybe twitter
- Reason: Ha, you realize we're sigdave right? (we should probably explain what SigDave is about somewhere on this site)
- Goals: See Reason

# DJ Roomba Updates #
## Classic Controller ##
I tested with my classic controller...here's some notes
- permission issues...udev rules need to set mode to 0644
- just acts as a seperate character device
