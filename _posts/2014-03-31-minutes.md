title: We shoulda bought a real Wiimote
---

## Good News ##
- The wii classic controller and then filter came in!!!
- We also got the funding requests in for the Food Button
## Bad News ##
The knock off wiimote doesn't seem to handle the classic controller extension properly.
I haven't tested it with an actual wii...but I did test it against hid-wiimote as well as
the dolphin emulator (linux).

### When I tested hid-wiimote ###
- Real Wiimote + Real Classic Controller : Worked
- Real Wiimote + Fake Classic Controller : Worked
- Fake Wiimote + Real Classic Controller : Only joystick works
- Fake Wiimote + Fake Classic Controller : Only joystick works

### When I tested dolphin ###
- Fake Wiimote refused to stay connected....

### Theories ###
While it may just be that the fake wiimote doesn't properly talk to the classic controller,
it may be that the driver is screwing up. If I or someone else gets particularly inspired....
we can look if any packets are being sent when the buttons get clicked.
