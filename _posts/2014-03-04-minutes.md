title: Wiimote controls and bugs
---

Today we (Zane and I) worked through a few bugs in the joystick library and the turret drive.
Summarizing:

- Wiimote seems to send extra 0 values for each input (need to compare with ps3 controller)
- When a driver starts, it should flush the queue
- Limit the size of a drive queue to 2 elements, (promote realtime'esq controls)

Also, there's a request for a wii classic controller extension knockoff...so we should have more buttons soon.
