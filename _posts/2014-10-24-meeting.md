So, all the parts we need to get started have finally arrived (lamp, web-cam, button,
beaglebone black).

The lamp (pictured below) was extremely easy to work with. To mount the web-cam the light bulb 
attached at the end was removed.

The current camera mount is a bit of a hack, largely consisting of a small 
screw squeezed between to pieces of plastic. We might consider 3d printing a better one.

Finally, here are all the main components hooked up. All that's missing is an enclosure!
For software, the beaglebone black is pretty easy to work with. We already can take a 
picture and then tweet it. Reading whether button has been pressed seems to be a matter 
of reading a file on the beagle bone (/sys/class/gpio/gpio/gpio60/value for example).
