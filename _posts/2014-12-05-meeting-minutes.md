# DJ Roomba Reboot

First things first, DJ Roomba's lights are almost completely 
soldered. As such we've started to reboot active development on 
DJ Roomba in preparation for EOH. A food tray/party platter for
holding snacks as well as an infrared sensor for following 
preconfigured paths have been discussed at future additions.

## Party Platter ##

- Will be positioned near the top of DJ roomba (potentially multi 
layered). 
- To prevent excessive vibration, contact with the speaker
might need to be cushioned by high desnsity foam.
- High walls are preferable to avoid food falling out due to music 
or roomba movement.

## Line Following ##

To facilitate automated servicing of party guests, we hope to 
incorporate preconfigured paths that DJ Roomba will move along.

The plan is to use an infrared sensor array to follow the line,
perhaps with some ultrasonic sensors to detect if people are getting 
food from the tray or in the way.

# Whiteboard Sticker

When developing all of our projects, we always wished there was an accessible
whiteboard to work with in the back room. Furthermore, we figured it'd be nice to
be able to place parts directly on it to make measurements and facilitate
design. As such we installed some whiteboard sticker decals on tables in
the backroom.

# Waiting for Prints

We're almost done with the Food Button. Just waiting for the enclosure 
to be printed! STAY TUNED!!!!!!!!!
