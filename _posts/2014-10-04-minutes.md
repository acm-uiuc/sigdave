Due to Reflections Projections we deferred work on DJ Roomba till next week.
In the mean time we decided to figure out the best way to capture webcam images
for the food button.

Turns out FFMPEG + Video4Linux2 work really well for this.

{% highlight bash %}
ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0 -vframes 2 test%3d.jpeg
{% endhighlight %}

The reason for 2 frames is for most cameras the first frame ends up being too dark (the aperture
hasn't been exposed to enough light).

We could then easily upload to twitter as follows:

{% highlight python %}
from subprocess import check_call
from twython import Twython

FFMPEG_CMD = ['ffmpeg',
              '-f' ,'video4linux2',
              '-i',  '/dev/video0',
              '-vframes', '2',
              'img%3d.jpeg']

check_call(FFMPEG_CMD)

twitter = Twython(APP_KEY, APP_SECRET,
                  OAUTH_TOKEN, OAUTH_SECRET)
                  
with open('img002.jpeg', 'rb') as f:
    twitter.update_status_with_media(media=f, status="It's Working!")
{% endhighlight %}

Anywho, next week if the Beaglebone comes in we'll do food button stuff.
If not, we've got some soldering left for DJ Roomba :p
