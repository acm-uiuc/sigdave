# Recap #
Today we were able to make some serious progress for the led lights.
Here's an image from today:

## Reusing broken led rope ##
So we figured out the led rope can be wired from either side, so we can use
our new heat shrink wrap reinforcement technique to attach the leads.

## Turret ##
- Fixed the bugs with incorrect value mapping from the joystick subsystem.
- Attached new leads on the laser sight for the turret, so we should be able to control it via a transistor.

## Audio to LED's ##
- We should be able to finish by next week! I plan on writing up some accompanying software soon.
- http://freshfoo.com/blog/pulseaudio_monitoring provides a description of reading pulse audio's audio
- We should be able to use this for the visualization
- Lastly, we plan on putting color tissue paper over the LEDs to give the sections color

## Safety First ##
- We're gonna try and purchase a fume extractor for all the soldering... no reason not to have one
