## LEDS ##
So today we finally started mounting the LED's for DJ Roomba...
Here's a picture:

After a few logistic and technical issues (turns out its easy to pull out the copper leads on the led rope), we able to mount a few strips.
The next Saturday meeting will probably go much faster, so I'll try and have some software for testing the lights by then.

## Joystick Library ##
So I've been working on the joystick library to go with the DJ Roomba project. I decided to refactor it to look abit like flask:
Here's a taste
```python
@app.register('BTN_DPAD_DOWN', ROOMBA_QUEUE, weight=-1)
@app.register('BTN_DPAD_UP', ROOMBA_QUEUE, weight=1)
def straight(val):
    return ('drive_straight', val*300)

@app.register('BTN_DPAD_LEFT', ROOMBA_QUEUE, weight=-1)
@app.register('BTN_DPAD_RIGHT', ROOMBA_QUEUE, weight=1)
def turn(val):
    return ('drive', -val*300, 0)

@app.register('BTN_START', ROOMBA_QUEUE)
def reset(_):
    return ('control',)
```

So far so good on that front. There's even a chance it may get broken out into a seperate joystick project.

## Travis and Testing ##
Speaking of being broken out into seperate projects....I ported CS 424's Roomba module (to python3 + bluetooth) awhile back for DJ Roomba.
I just put it up on pypi in preparation for being able to run tests via Travis CI....
That said, I need to figure out how to get Travis CI to monitor this project since its under ACM....time to ask around
