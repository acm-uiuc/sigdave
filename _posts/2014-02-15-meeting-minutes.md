title:  "Saturday Meeting Minutes"
---

So I (Marcell V.C) was the only one who showed up today's meeting :( (although Sam Laane dropped by at the end).
Since I was the only one there I figured it'd be best to spend my time working on code rather than hardware.

## Today's Tasks ##
- Build a prototype diagram of the DJ Roomba project [using the diagrams haskell dsl](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/)
- Build the turret driver subsystem, now listens on the t.drive queue for the following instructions:
 - up, down, left, right, stop, fire
- Explained to Sam the overall system architecture, and the plans related to turret

## New TODOs ##
- Consolidate TODO's into project based lists
- Make a DJ Roomba specific site (using github pages)
- Write a wiimote joystick config for working with dj roomba
