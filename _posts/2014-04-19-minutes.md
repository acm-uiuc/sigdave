# Wow, Much clean, Very ordered #

- We've acquired an organizer and a toolbox to really start getting our cabinet under control
- It's also worth noting that the food light is here...just waiting on the camera and beaglebone black.

# Testing the relay #
So I hooked up the relay module to the turret's laser sight. It was fairly easy to hookup, just needs 12V (or more its got a regulator) to power the actual mechanical movement, 5 volts for the selection, and then each relay is active low.

## Missing 9 Volts ##
So it seems out 9 Volt batteries have been removed from our cabinet :/  ....
this isn't entirely shocking given how our helping hand and fume extractor seem to have been appropriated by the office...
Oh well C'est la vie.

## Female to Male Jumper Wire ##

The Relay board uses male pins for control. This means we may find it prudent to acquire some female to male jumper wires. (I used my own in this video...along with two 9 volts)

# Future #

## PS3 Controller is here ##

Pictured here along with the relay, we finally have a legit controller. Given this is the type of controller I originally developed the joystick library for, we should be good on compatibility (assuming sixad plays nicely on the pi....otherwise I'll need to make an another driver).

## Mount all the things!!! ##

So, we're finally at the stage where we can mount everything. If we raise the speaker mount (on some stilts), we should be able to cleanly fit all the parts under it. It'll move the center of mass up abit, but I think it'll be negligible....if not there's always the prospect of going double roomba (we do have 2 after all).

## Colorizing the lights ##

Tissue paper is in (its the square against the right wall in the cabinet picture). Now, is it more sig dave like to randomly put it on...or actually plan this out :p
