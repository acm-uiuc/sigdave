title: Wiimote + Making Wire
---

# Today's tasks #

## Wiimote ##

- Zane and I troubleshooted the Wiimote issues we experienced last week
- We found that the batteries were too low power to connect to the pc
- Using the hid_wiimote kernel module instead of cwiid, we can use uinput which is what the joystick daemon does.

## Stripping wires ##

- We (mostly Zane) also cut and stripped some wires in prep for mounting them onto the Roomba
